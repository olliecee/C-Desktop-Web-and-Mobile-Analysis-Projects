# Creating .NET apps using the .NET Core 1.1 SDK + .NET Framework.

Mainly using VS2015 Enterprise + VS Code (for cross-platform programming) with C# and .NET Core! The use of the original .NET Framework will be used here just as a scaffolding template, otherwise I recommend checking out the ASP.NET Core applications being written here.

##ASP.NET Core - MVC-PRO1

The directory containing:
```
ASP.NET Core - MVC-PRO1
```
This will contain an MVC structure using ASP.NET Core made from scratch. It will include dependencies, tooling and various plugins to better explore the options and new technologies C# 6 and what .NET Core can provide!
